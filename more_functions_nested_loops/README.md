Using more functions and more nested loops, we'll be looking to write functions that:
- check for uppercase characters
- check for a digit
- multiply two integers
- print the numbers from 0 to 9
- the same thing, but excluding 2 and 4 this time
- print numbers from 0 to 14, ten times, each on their own line
- draw a straight line in the terminal using _
- draw a diagonal line on the terminal using \
- print a square using #
- print the numbers from 1 to 100. Multiples of 3 are replaced by Fizz, and multiples of 5 are replaced by Buzz. Multiples of both are replaced by FizzBuzz
- print a triangle using #
